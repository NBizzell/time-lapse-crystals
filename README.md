#Time Lapse Crystals Scheme of Work

##Introduction
This scheme of work is a cross curricular project involving computer science and Chemistry. The students will set up and program a Raspberry Pi and Pi Camera to record the growth of crystals in a petri dish.

This scheme of work is specifically targetted towards KS3 Computer Science and KS3 Science.

##Students will learn:
Over the course of the lessons, students will learn:
- How to set up the Raspberry Pi and Pi Camera.

##Computing Programme of Study Met:
###KS3:
- Use 2 or more programming languages, at least one of which is textual, to solve a variety of computational problems; make appropriate use of data structures [for example, lists, tables or arrays]; design and develop modular programs that use procedures or functions.

###Partially meets:
- Understand the hardware and software components that make up computer systems, and how they communicate with one another and with other systems.
- Understand how instructions are stored and executed within a computer system; understand how data of various types (including text, sounds and pictures) can be represented and manipulated digitally, in the form of binary digits.

##Resources
For the majority of the lessons, it is suggested that work is carried out by students in pairs. Each pair should have access to the standard equipment described below:
- A Raspberry Pi per pair;
- A Pi Camera Module per pair;
- A keyboard and mouse connected to the RPi per pair;
- A monitor connected to the RPi per pair;


##Lessons
- Lesson 1 - Settting up the Camera;
- Lesson 2 - Time-lapse Photography;
- Lesson 3 - Crystal Formation;
- Lesson 4 - Experiment set up ;
- Lesson 5 - Creating a Time-Lapse video;
- Lesson 6 - Comparing the results;
