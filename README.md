#Time Lapse Crystals Scheme of Work

##Introduction
This scheme of work is a cross curricular project involving Computer Science and Chemistry. The students will set up and program a Raspberry Pi and Pi Camera Module to record the growth of crystals in a petri dish.

This scheme of work is specifically targetted towards KS3 Computer Science and KS3 Science.

If students have little or no exposure to Python it might be worth trying some simple exercises first for example the [Story time with Python exercise from the Raspberry Pi Foundation]
(http://www.raspberrypi.org/learning/storytime/). There is also a small project version of this scheme for less advanced students (written for KS1/2 Home educated children here) - add link when done

##Students will learn:
Over the course of the lessons, students will learn:
- How to set up the Raspberry Pi and Pi Camera Module.
- How to use python to control the Pi Camera Module.
- How to create a saturated solution.
- How crystals are formed.
- How to seperate a solution using evaporation.
- How changing variables affects the rate of crystal formation.
- How to use python to take time-lapse photographs.
- How to edit the photographs into a time-laspe video.

##Computing Programme of Study Met:
###KS3:
- Use 2 or more programming languages, at least one of which is textual, to solve a variety of computational problems; make appropriate use of data structures [for example, lists, tables or arrays]; design and develop modular programs that use procedures or functions.

###Partially meets:
- Understand the hardware and software components that make up computer systems, and how they communicate with one another and with other systems.
- Understand how instructions are stored and executed within a computer system; understand how data of various types (including text, sounds and pictures) can be represented and manipulated digitally, in the form of binary digits.

##Science Programme of Study Met:
As the scheme involves a chemistry practical investigation the Scheme also meets or partially meets the following points from the Science Programmes of Study:

###KS3:
####Scientific attitudes
- Pay attention to objectivity and concern for accuracy, precision, repeatability and 
reproducibility
- Understand that scientific methods and theories develop as earlier explanations are 
modified to take account of new evidence and ideas, together with the importance of 
publishing results and peer review
- Evaluate risks. 

####Experimental skills and investigations
- Make predictions using scientific knowledge and understanding
- Select, plan and carry out the most appropriate types of scientific enquiries to test 
predictions, including identifying independent, dependent and control variables, where 
appropriate
- Use appropriate techniques, apparatus, and materials during fieldwork and laboratory 
work, paying attention to health and safety
- Make and record observations and measurements using a range of methods for 
different investigations; and evaluate the reliability of methods and suggest possible 
improvements

####Pure and impure substances
- Mixtures, including dissolving
- Simple techniques for separating mixtures: filtration, evaporation, distillation and 
chromatography

####Physical changes
- Conservation of material and of mass, and reversibility, in melting, freezing, 
evaporation, sublimation, condensation, dissolving

##Resources
For the majority of the lessons, it is suggested that work is carried out by students in pairs. Each pair should have access to the standard equipment described below:
- A Raspberry Pi per pair
- A Pi Camera Module per pair
- A keyboard and mouse connected to the RPi per pair
- A monitor connected to the RPi per pair

For the crystal formation lessons students will also need:
- Copper sulphate and water (or a preprepared saturated solution of copper sulphate)
- Glass beakers
- Petri dishes
- Bunsen burner, stand and mat(if preparing their own solutions)
- Safety glasses / goggles
