#Leson 3 - Setting up the experiment 

In this Lesson students learn how to setup an experiment seperating a solution.

## Learning objectives

- Understand how the setup the Raspberry Pi and Camera to record a timelapse video.
- Know how to seperate a solution.
- Develop students practical science skills

## Learning outcomes

### All Students are able to:
- Set up the Raspberry Pi and Pi Camera to take timelaspes photographs

### Most Students are able to:
- Set up an experiment to seperate a solution by evaporation.
- Recall and understand the correct meaning of the key words, Solute, Solution, Solvent Dissovle, Evaporate.
- Create a saturated Copper Sulphate solution.

### Some Students are able to:
- Set up thier experiment and Raspberry Pi to record timelaspe photographs


## Lesson summary

### Starter

1. Students to set up Raspberry Pi and Pi Camera modules. Test to ensure they are working correctly.

### Main development

1. Explaination of Mixtures and solutions, how solutes desolve in Solvents, soutes only dissolve in certain liquids.
1. Discussion on how mistures / solutions can be seperated. Draw out filtering, evaporation (possibly also distillation and chromatography)
1. Explain the practical experiment (either to create and then seperate a solution by evaporation or just evaporation).
1. Highlight safety issues and precautions for the experiment [CLEAPS safety card for Copper Sulphate](http://www.cleapss.org.uk/attachments/article/0/SSS40.pdf?Secondary/Science/Student%20Safety%20Sheets/).
1. Divide students into groups and hand out equipment.
1. Students to set up experiment using the [worksheet](worksheet1.md).
1. Studets to place experiments in a place tha is safe for them to be left and add the solution / start taking photographs.
1. Clear away remaning practical equipment. 

### Plenary

1. Question students on Solutions key words and meanings
1. Remind students of safety points of experiment.
1. Question students on what they expect to see happen. 

### Homework
Write up the experiment Method.
