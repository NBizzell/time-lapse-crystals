# Lesson 2 - Time-lapse Photography

In this Lesson students learn how to setup the Raspberry Pi and Pi Camera to take time-lapse pictures using python and/or the command line. 


## Learning objectives

- Revise how the Raspberry Pi and Pi Camera are setup
- Know how to take time-lapse pictures with the Pi Camera using python
- Know how to take time-lapse pictures with the Pi Camera using the command line

## Learning outcomes

### All Students are able to:
- Set up the Raspberry Pi and Pi Camera and take a series of time-lapse photographs

### Most Students are able to:
- Take time-lapse photographs using the command line
- Understand how to change the variable when using the command line for time-lapse photography

### Some Students are able to:
- Take time-lapse photographs using python
- Understand how to alter the python script to change the way the time-lapse photographs are taken.

## Lesson summary

### Starter

1. Students set up the Raspberry Pi and Pi Camera Module ready for use in the lesson.
1. Students take a picture to test the camera module is working correctly.

### Main development

1. Students to attempt a short time-lapse sequence (of the classroom) using the command line using the [Command line Time-lapse](worksheet1.md) worksheet for support.
1. Students to attempt a short time-lapse sequence (of the classroom) using the Python using the [Python Time-lapse](worksheet2.md) worksheet for support.
1. Students combine their pictures into a time-lapse movie using the [Time-lapse video](worksheet3.md) for support

### Plenary

1. Each group is invited to demonstrate the movies they have created. 
2. Students to pack up Raspberry Pi, Pi Camera Modules and classroom.

### Extension

1. Students can attempt to take time-lapse photographs using a Bash Script using [Bash Time-lapse](worksheet4.md) worksheet for support
