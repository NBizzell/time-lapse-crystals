#Python Timelapse Photography

A time-lapse sequence can be easily constructed by running the basic capture program in a loop, and adjusting the delay to the gap required. Timelapse sequences can be used to visualise many natural processes that are not easy to see otherwise such as plant growth and decay, long term construction projects and weather cycles. Here is some example code:

```python
import picamera
import RPi.GPIO as GPIO

GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BCM)
GPIO.setup(17, GPIO.IN, GPIO.PUD_UP)

with picamera.PiCamera() as camera:
    camera.start_preview()
    frame = 1
    while True:
        GPIO.wait_for_edge(17, GPIO.FALLING)
        camera.capture('/home/pi/Desktop/frame%03d.jpg' % frame)
        frame += 1
    camera.stop_preview()
```
